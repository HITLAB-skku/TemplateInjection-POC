This artifact contains PoC scripts and demo samples for Section 5.1 of our paper. Our attack accesses the victim's device and performs authentication using the attacker's sensor.
The entire attack requires physical access to the device, so it cannot be executed by code alone.

The PoC script includes the part that creates an attacker's template — which is accepted by the victim's system — from data extracted from the victim's partition as described in the paper.

In the actual attack we booted the victim device into a other bootable OS (ex. Windows PE)  and carried out that process, but for review purposes we assume certain files were already extracted and implemented the subsequent steps in code.

Upon execution, the PoC produces a crafted biometric template. When this template is injected into the victim device’s WinBio database and a biometric authentication attempt is performed, the authentication is accepted and the system is successfully bypassed.
